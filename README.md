# Evolution-of-English

## I'm trying to use modern technology(artificial intelligence) to protect the future of English

### Obviously, this is done in an isotropic manner, and many assumptions are being made: here they are:

#### No other language really evolves.

    To be able to do this without making absolutely insane rabbit holes, we're going to assume that all other languages stay the same when they mix

#### The order of influence on English:

    Chinese will be the biggest influence on English, with a disproportionate incluence.

Second will be Spanish, followed by Hindi, French, Arabic, German, Punjabi, Japanese, Korean(south), and Russian

#### We're using British English.

    Indian and American terms adopted by many speakers will also be there.
